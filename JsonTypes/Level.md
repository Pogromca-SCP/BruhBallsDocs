# Level
This type is used to describe custom level that can be loaded and played in game. A level is a collection of actors that are spawned, before the game starts.

### Properties
- `actors` - `Array<`[Actor](Actor.md)`>` - Array of actors to spawn. This property is very important, since actors are basic elements used to create level's structure.
